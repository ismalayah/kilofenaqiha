Recommended Videos If you’d thought that the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen was fast-paced, the Shibuya Incident Arc is going to give the term a whole new meaning to you.
It’s not that it starts fast-paced from the onset, or that it’s a completely linear rising of tension and conflict. It sprinkles high-intensity moments here and there until it all just explodes into irredeemable circumstances and the stickiest situation the characters have ever been faced with in the story thus far — arguably even trickier and more grim than the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons featured in Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which took place the year prior.</description></item><item><title>Maam, I think the seal needs to help you: Woman freaks out after discovering very chill sea</title><link>/maam-i-think-the-seal-needs-to-help-you-woman-freaks-out-after-discovering-very-chill-seal-at-the-beach.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/maam-i-think-the-seal-needs-to-help-you-woman-freaks-out-after-discovering-very-chill-seal-at-the-beach.html</guid><description>The urge to help an animal that’s in need is a pretty surefire way of determining a good person from a bad one, but it’s important to stress that a lot of animals are more durable and self-sufficient than you might think.
